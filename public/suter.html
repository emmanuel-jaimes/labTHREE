                    <h1>Brendan Suter</h1>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Brendan Suter and I'm a Computer Science and Engineering Major
                        at the University of Iowa. I've come to enjoy my time at the University and
                        can't wait to see what the future has in store.
                    </p>
                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I grew up not 30 minutes north of campus in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Being so close meant
                        that I knew I wanted to be a Hawkeye for as long as I can remember. I spent much of
                        my life as a home-body and would find myself learning everything I could about history,
                        culture, faith, and more. I would be lying if I said that took up most of my time however,
                        as I could rarely go a day without playing Minecraft. When High School arrived, that began to
                        change. I would spend most of my time involved with Cross-Country, Track, Marching Band, Show Choir
                        Band, and more. Now, my free time is spent on many of my hobbies.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Skills and Coding Experience</h1>
                    <p>Throughout my time at the University of Iowa, I've learned many different types of tools and languages.
                        These various environment taught me vital skills that I'm sure to apply after graduation. These range from
                        simple concepts like polymorphism to complex topics like concurrency and MVC architecture. I've learned in 
                        Python, C++, Java, Ruby, Haskell, Assembly, and more. Yet, they've produced project I'm quite proud of.
                        Here are some of my favorites,
                    </p>
                    <ul id="projects">
                        <li>Kings Corners (Python)</li>
                        <li>2D Racing Game (C++)</li>
                        <li>College Football Ranking Generator and Odds Predictor(Java)</li>
                        <li>Electoral College Editor (Java)</li>
                        <li>RFID Test Center Scanner (Embedded C)</li>
                        <li>Secure Wireless Temperature Sensor (Embedded C++ & Java)</li>
                        <li>Online Ecommerce Website (Ruby)</li>

                    <h2>Internship Opportunity</h2>
                    <p>My education at Iowa gave me the opportunity to work an internship over summer 2023. I ended up working for 
                        Genova Technologies in Cedar Rapids, and I enjoyed my time there. Genova was contracting to John Deere at the
                        time to provide embedded software engineering solutions to their latest line of combines. My team, the Green Reapers,
                        was tasked with implementing new functionality to grain headers and I spent a lot of time immersed in their Agile-based 
                        system. Bench Testing, Code Reviews, Writing Tests, were all important experiences I intent to bring into my professional
                        career. Yet, my favorite experience was my trip to Silvis where I got to spend my day with the combines for testing.
                        Those machines are a lot bigger up close. Overall, it was quite a positive experience and I look forward to starting a 
                        career doing much of the same work.
