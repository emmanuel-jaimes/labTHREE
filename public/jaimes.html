                    <h1>Welcome,</h1>
                    <p>My name is Emmanuel Jaimes and I am currently studying Computer Science 
                        & Engineering at the University of Iowa. I have enjoyed my time at Iowa 
                        these last years and look forward for what is to come. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>A little bit about me...</h3>
                    <p>Born and raised in Dallas, Texas I came to Iowa to experience what it is like to really have snow... and it truly 
                        is an "experience". When I am not in class, I find myself dabbling in a good amount of activities ranging from 
                        playing futbol, losing in chess, engaging in photography, and even learning some mixology. If there is something 
                        that I am interested in doing, I'll do it. </p>
